# iTerm2 Configuration

Please make sure iTerm2 is configured to load from \`~/.config/iterm2\`.

That should look something like this:

\` iTerm2 > Preferences > General > Preferences \`

\`\`\`
…
…    _
    [X] Load preferences from a custom folder or URL
…    ___________________________
    [_~/.config/iterm2__________] [Browse]
…
…
\`\`\`

## Color scheme import

This happens in a dropdown at the bottom right corer of:

\` iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > [Profile Name] > Colors \`

Typically, \`[Profile Name]\` will be \`Default\`, but not necessarily.

There should be a bunch in \`~/.iterm2-color-schemes\`; it may be helpful to
find this directory in the Finder dialog by showing hidden files with the
keyboard shortcut \`CMD + SHIFT + .\`.

# Shell Restart

If this is the very first time running this on a machine, you may want to
restart the shell or just hop into a new tab from this point.

I'd like to automate that, but nothing I've tried so far has been able to do
the final transition from macOS' very old bash to zsh automatically, so it's
still a bit manual for now.

# That's It!

You can exit by pressing 'q'.
