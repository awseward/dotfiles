# Notes

## iTerm2 Configuration

Please make sure iTerm2 is configured to load from \`~/.iterm\`.

This can be configured by navigating to \`Preferences > General\` and then
looking for the phrase (near the bottom):

\`Load preferences from a custom folder or URL\`

Also, when importing color schemes from \`~/.iterm2-color-schemes\`, in case
finder is not configured to show hidden files/folders, you can quickly toggle
this with \`CMD + SHIFT + .\`.

Don't forget to not only import it, but then also configure it to be used as
well.

## SSH Configuration

This setup process currently attempts to auto-setup ssh keys, but does not
attempt to do anything for \`~/.ssh/config\`.
