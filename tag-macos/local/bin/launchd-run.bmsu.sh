  #
  # For now, we can make an attempt to meet at least this part of the spec:
  #
  # > The directory MUST be owned by the user, and he MUST be the only one
  # > having read and write access to it. Its Unix access mode MUST be 0700.
  #
  # Although, this DOESN'T comply with others, like:
  #
  # > The lifetime of the directory MUST be bound to the user being logged in. It
  # > MUST be created when the user first logs in and if the user fully logs out
  # > the directory MUST be removed. If the user logs in more than once he should
  # > get pointed to the same directory, and it is mandatory that the directory
  # > continues to exist from his first login to his last logout on the system,
  # > and not removed in between. Files in the directory MUST not survive reboot
  # > or a full logout/login cycle.
  #
  # Oh well, I just want to have a service that doesn't hang when logs get
  # rotatedâ€¦
