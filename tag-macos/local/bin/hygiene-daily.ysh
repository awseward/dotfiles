    === Hygiene Script ===

    This is a script of hygiene tasks to be run regularly. Things like upgrading
    and pruning dependencies, mostly.

    Currently its main motivation is to encapsulate a system that is split between
    homebrew and nix.

    USAGES

      • $f_ upgrade

        Upgrade dependencies.

      • $f_ prune

        Clean up leftover cruft from dependency tools.
