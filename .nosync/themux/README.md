# themux

A silly little thing for theming tmux (`theme + tmux = themux`) ðŸ¤·

### Basic usage

`./themux.sh choose` will bring up an interactive experience choose a theme.

Worth noting, if you don't have any Dhall Prelude stuff cached, the first time
you run this it may appear to hang for a bit but after that it should be
pretty quick.
