NOTE: Please make sure iTerm2 is configured to load from "~/.iterm".

      This can be configured by navigating to "Preferences > General" and then
      looking for the phrase (near the bottom):

        "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL"

NOTE: This setup process currently does not account for any ssh configuration.

      Such things will bave to be managed manually for now.
